# akari-game-gui

The Akari Game is a fun and challenging single-player logic puzzle. I developed an Akari GUI using Java and the JavaFX library. 

I used Maven to manage dependencies and streamline the build process, and I structured the project with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to keep the code organized and modular. In the game, players solve puzzles by strategically placing lamps to light up corridors, meeting clue requirements, and avoiding illegal placements. It features real-time feedback, a reset button for quick restarts, and easy navigation through a library of puzzles, making it both intuitive and engaging to play.
